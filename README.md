# Tese_Mestrado — EGW: Digital Twin Edge Gateway (Theme 1, C2DTA)

> Consumer-Controlled Digital Twin Architecture — master's dissertation, ISCTE-IUL.
> Workflow: commits and pull requests on `dev`; `main` receives stable versions
> only, by pull request.

Implementation and dissertation of a reproducible ARM64 Edge Gateway
(Yocto/Scarthgap plus containerised services) that receives synthetic telemetry
from three wearable device types, validates the events and materialises them as
digital twins in Eclipse Ditto.

**Normative source:** `PLANO_DESENVOLVIMENTO_INTEGRADO_EDGE_GATEWAY_2026.md`
(integrated plan, v1.0 — 2026-08-07). It is held in the workspace OUTSIDE this
repository, so it is deliberately not a link; the language migration converts it
to `docs/governance/INTEGRATED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_2026.md`. This repository follows
the P0 scope of that plan; see [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for the state of each
gate.

## Structure (follows the C2DTA Student Repository Template)

## Getting started

- Python implementation (simulator, controller, harness): see [src/README.md](src/README.md).
- Deploying the DT stack on ARM64: see [src/deployment/README.md](src/deployment/README.md).
- Yocto/QEMU build: see [src/yocto/README.md](src/yocto/README.md).
- Preparing the environment (WSL2, ARM VM): see [docs/setup/](docs/setup/).
- Documentation index, including the risk register and the claim→evidence
  matrix: see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Rules of this repository

- Nothing is declared "Done" without verifiable evidence (commit, log, test, data).
- `experiments/results/raw/` is immutable after the data freeze (`data-v1`).
- No quantitative figure enters the dissertation without raw data, a manifest
  and an analysis script.
- QEMU evidence is functional only: it never supports a performance statement.
- Secrets never enter Git; `src/deployment/.env.example` exists for that purpose.
- British English is the working language of the repository
  ([docs/governance/language-policy.md](docs/governance/language-policy.md)); the
  mandatory Portuguese Resumo and drafts of external administrative
  communication are the exceptions.
